                    <p>Melbourne's train network is a vital part of the city’s public transport system, serving thousands of
                        commuters every day. As the city grows, understanding which train stations experience the highest
                        ridership is crucial for ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated and services meet demand.
                        This visualisation aims to provide insights into the busiest train stations across different lines in
                        Melbourne.</p>

                    <p>The graph on the right displays the total yearly passengers in Melbourne over several years. Ridership
                        was relatively high during FY18-19, peaking before a significant decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
                        This drop reflects the impact of pandemic-related restrictions,
                        such as lockdowns and an increase in remote work.
                        
                        In subsequent years, ridership shows a steady recovery, though it has not yet reached pre-pandemic
                        levels.</p>

            <p> From the map below, it is evident that the busiest train stations in Melbourne are primarily located within the CBD; Colloquially known as the City Loop Stations.
                This concentration of activity is largely due to the CBD being the city’s economic and commercial hub, where a vast number of offices, retail stores, and entertainment venues are located. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of City Loop Stations, the most busy stations are those served as a hub for multiple train lines, where its the last shared station before individual services go to their exclusive stations.
                An example would be Dandenong where it is the last shared station before Pakenham and Cranbourne services.

                    <p>The most busy station in the City Loop is the Flinders Street Station, followed by Southern Cross Station
                        (used to be called Spencer Street Station) and Melbourne Central. </p>
                    <p>It is unsuprising as Flinders Street Station is a connection hub for every line in Melbournes Train
                        system. </p>
                    <p>Southern Cross resides in a more business focused area, many passengers get off there to go to work.</p>
                    <p>Apart from also being a major hub for most services, Melbourne Central is also surrounded by wide range
                        of retail stores, restaurants and entertainment options. It busyness also boosted by its close proximity
                        to RMIT University.</p>
