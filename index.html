            <p> From the map below, it is evident that the busiest train stations in Melbourne are primarily located within the CBD; Colloquially known as the City Loop Stations.
                This concentration of activity is largely due to the CBD being the city’s economic and commercial hub, where a vast number of offices, retail stores, and entertainment venues are located. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of City Loop Stations, the most busy stations are those served as a hub for multiple train lines, where its the last shared station before individual services go to their exclusive stations.
                An example would be Dandenong where it is the last shared station before Pakenham and Cranbourne services.
